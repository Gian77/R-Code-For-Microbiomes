# R_code_for_microbiomes

This repo contains R scripts for Microbiomes and Communities studies.

The code was developed with the aim to share tricks and/or solutions I have adoped to perform community alpha- and beta-diversity studies. R packages and functions are hilighted in order to make codes easily to riproduce.

Any tip is welcome to imporve and/or integrate what I did, sharing knowledge is at the base of data science ;)

Have fun!
