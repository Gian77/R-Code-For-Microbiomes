__R Code For Microbiomes__

This repository contains `R scripts` for Microbiome studies.<br>
The code was developed with the aim to share tricks and/or solutions I have adopted to perform community alpha- and beta-diversity analysis. R packages and functions are highlighted in order to make codes easily to reproduce. Any tip is welcome to improve and/or integrate what I did, sharing knowledge is at the base of data science.<br>

Have fun!<br>
