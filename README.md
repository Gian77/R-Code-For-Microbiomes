__R Code For Microbiomes__

This repository contains `R scripts` for Microbiome studies.<br>

The code was developed with the aim to share tricks and/or solutions I have adopted to perform community alpha- and beta-diversity analyses. R packages and functions are highlighted in order to make codes easy to reproduce. Any tip is welcome to improve and/or integrate what I did, I believe that shared knowledge is at the base of data science.<br>

Have fun!<br>
